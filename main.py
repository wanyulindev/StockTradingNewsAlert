## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co  VVVVV
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday
# then print("Get News").

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org  VVVVV
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

## STEP 3: Use https://www.twilio.com
# Send a seperate message with the percentage change and each article's title
# and description to your phone number.


#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
"""

# My Bug:
# Since they are all three queued. could you tell me why I only got two SMS?
# GPT:
# The reason you are receiving only two SMS messages instead of three could be due to
# various factors, and it might require some debugging to identify the exact cause.
# Here are some potential reasons:
#
# News Availability: There may not have been enough relevant news articles available in
# the specified date range and search criteria to fulfill all three messages. If the API
# did not return three articles, you would have fewer SMS messages.
#
# Twilio Limitations: Twilio may have limitations on sending messages in quick succession.
# It's possible that there was a rate-limiting issue or an issue with sending multiple
# messages within a short timeframe.
#
# Conditional Logic: Your code may have conditional logic that filters out some articles
# based on certain criteria. Ensure that your code is correctly filtering and selecting
# the articles to send as messages.
#
# Error Handling: Check for any errors or exceptions that might have occurred during the
# execution of your code. An error could have interrupted the process of sending the
# third SMS.
#
# To troubleshoot this issue:
#
# Verify that the News API is returning the expected number of articles.
# Check for any error messages or exceptions in your code or logs.
# Add debugging statements or print statements to track the flow of your code and see
# which articles are being processed and sent as SMS messages.
# By systematically examining these factors and debugging your code, you should be able
# to determine why you are receiving only two SMS messages and address the issue
# accordingly.
